## Overview

This is a personal project that I developed aiming to practice building a RESTful API using the Java framework Spring Boot.

The project consists of the back-end of a program for managing a restaurant. It handles and keeps track of the orders for both table- and takeaway-type bills.


## Setup

Java 17 is required to run this program, as well as PostgreSQL.

Before running the program, the database needs to be locally created by entering the following command in the terminal:
``createdb restaurant_api``

The endpoints can be accessed via an API platform such as Postman or through the browser at https://localhost:8080
